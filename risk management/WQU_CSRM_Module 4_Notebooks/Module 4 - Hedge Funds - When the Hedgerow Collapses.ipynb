    "The success of hedge funds fundamentally boils down to the question of market efficiency. If markets are perfectly efficient, the ability for hedge funds to return above-market risk-adjusted returns should be at best a matter of luck. While the religious believers of Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) might justify the notable successes of the Buffets, Simons and the Griffins of this world through the law of large numbers, the majority of studies indicate prices in most markets to be, at most, weak-form efficient.

    "Under the CAPM, an asset may only earn a higher average return given an increase in exposure to a comprehensive market portfolio, as denoted by $\\beta$, which should capture all systematic risk in the market. However, given that the market portfolio, which should exist as the universe of all investable assets, is not identifiable in reality, a market index is used as a proxy. While the application of CAPM is ubiquitous both in practice and in research, there exists numerous papers investigating markets around the work which critique its application over concerns over the emergence of stylized facts, the existence of cohesive market portfolios and many practical concerns over market concentration and liquidity.\n",

    "While a number of behavioral studies have been investigated in understanding non-randomness in markets, one on-going area of research has been in the use of factor models. Most factor models explore some combination of portfolio fundamentals in trying to analyze sources of non-systematic return. In seminal papers by Banz (1981) and Basu (1983), researchers explore the presence of a size- and value-effect in predicting expected returns. These factors analyze the Market Cap and PE-ratios of companies, under the APT framework, including these variables alongside the traditional market returns and risk-free rate.  \n",

    "While research into these anomalies has varied in its findings, suggesting them a possible function of market dynamics at a point in time, studies by Lizenverg & Ramasamy (1979), Stattman (1980) and Rosenberg (1885) suggest Dividend Yield and Book-to-Market as other significant stylized facts. This research is not limited to American and European markets. In studies around the world, researchers have identified factors like momentum, cashflows, NAV and sector index as factors relevant to particular markets. Some of the most famous studies in the area of factor models has been in the Fama-French 3- and 5-Factor models. These models include market returns, size, book-to-market, operating profitability and investment.  "

    "While the presence of these factors, many argue, provides a strong argument for the use of an exploration of statistical modelling in finance, there exist a number of counter-arguments which aim to break down the idea of just trying everything. The first argument raised by most efficiency market believers is about liquidity risk. While the size effect does indicate a negative correlation between size and expected returns, many smaller stocks are far less liquid on an exchange and, as such, present a risk to investors during times of extreme market failure. Secondly, opponents argue that many of these anomalies are temporal. In the book, The Quants, author Scott Patterson details the increasingly large leverage required by many funds towards the end of a particular trading strategies life-time as many new copy-cats enter a particular strategy. Lastly, often simple cost can limit the ability to act on a particular trade. Fundamentally, if one cannot realistically profit from a market anomaly or market inefficiency, then its ability to be realistically considered an argument in favour of market inefficiency is void."

    "Additionally, in the case of hedge funds, not only do these strategies need to exceed transaction costs and overcome liquidity risk in the market, but for the investor, trades must justify the cost structure of a hedge fund and the common lockup clause â which many argue presents an implied cost to the investor. While some may argue that active management ensures the pricing efficiency necessary in order to ensure passive funds can profit the reality is, from an investor point of view, Passive Funds have on average outperformed active management over a long time horizon.\n",

The [Podcast Freakonomics Radio](http://freakonomics.com/podcast/stupidest-thing-can-money/), has an interesting show on passive vs active investments. The show interviews Vanguage founder John C. Bogle who shares a lifetime of knowledge into running a passive fund and its growing acceptance among consumers.
