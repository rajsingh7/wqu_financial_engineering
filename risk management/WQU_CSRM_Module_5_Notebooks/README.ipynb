In order to do this we will be making use of Python 3.6.6.  Most of the reports will be done in [jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/about) which you have already explored and which allows you to integrating code, images, references and text all one file.  Most of the analysis will be done using [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html), a 'next-generation web-based user interface for Project Jupyter', or in Notebooks.  \n",

Code across all these assignment was run on [Ubuntu 18.04](http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/), and while that should not be an issue, if you are using Windows or Mac OS, if you run into trouble this may be the problem.  All these tools are free to use and download and have growing [support in companies in Data science and Finance](https://news.efinancialcareers.com/dk-en/197544/demand-programming-languages-wall-street).
